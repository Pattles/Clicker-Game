# Clicker Game
My attempt at creating a cookie clicker game, through the turtle library and [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXx3acg34S0&t=631s&ab_channel=TokyoEdtech). It only has the clicking aspect, doesn't save your score, and has no shop. Feel free to reuse the code.

The game itself, nothing new.

The menu, after clicking the hamburger icon in the top left.
